README 

This source code is built using Apache Maven 2. To build it, we're using version 2.2.1 of Maven on Java 1.6. You shouldn't have any problems in slightly different configurations, though. 

To run it, download Maven and ensure that the mvn command inside the Maven distribution's bin folder is on your path. Then, in the same directory as this README file, issue:

mvn clean install 

This will download all the dependencies. If you are using IntellIJ (7 or later) or Netbean 8.6 or later, or Eclipse with the M2Eclipse plugin, then there is a way to simply import the project. Your editor will configure the projects and the build paths based on the Maven metadata. 

Enjoy!
